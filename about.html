						<h2> What is this? </h2>
						<p>Ask-Around-the-World connects people across our planet and gives them the opportunity to ask the one question they think is the most important in the world. We encourage you to upload/record your question and to share it with everyone you know. If you only ever had one question, what would it be?</p>
					</section>
					
					<section id="why">
						<hr />
						<h2> Why submit videos to AskAround?</h2>
						<p>Well, for one, we have a whole bunch of prizes to give to our creative friends: books, DVDs, US$100 charity gift-vouchers and more. But you've got to be in it to win it!</p>
						<p>Many people have never thought to ask themselves what's the single most important question in the world. Ask Around the World is firstly a catalyst to make people think. Secondly, it's a place to listen and learn about what's important to other people around the planet.</p>

						<h2> What about my question?</h2>
						<p>Nobody will answer every question posted on the site. Ask Around the World is, however, an initiative of AskVote.com, an online platform for asking questions and engaging in intelligent debate. AskVote.com is the next generation of online conversation. Sign up for our mailing list on the main page and be one of the first to take part in this exciting project.</p>
						<strong>Will my video be published?</strong>
						<p>We reserve the right to approve or not approve each submission on a case by case basis. There's no guarantee that your video will make the cut, so try to ask a good question and try to have fun and be creative.</p>
						<strong>You say there are prizes?</strong>
						<p>We'll award prizes for video questions that have lots of personality and that might show interesting things in the background. If you're in Italy you might ask your question with the Colosseum behind you. In southern Africa, it could be an elephant in the frame. It could be with friends from school, university or work. It could involve silly props and funny interpretive dancing.  We'd love a deep and meaningful question from a talking bird. Feel free to be serious or to have fun with your short video question (10 seconds or less). Just provide us with a snapshot of the place in which you live.</p>
						
					</section>
					
					<section id="charity">
						<hr />
						<h2> And who benefits from all this?</h2>
						<p>For each video that we publish, we'll donate US$1 to charity. We have chosen a range of charities that cover a range of key causes around the world. We will only donate to non-denominational organisations.</p>
						<p>Our real goal is: </p>
